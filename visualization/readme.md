## Key Insights for Presentation

> The biggest insights is the pattern from the two type of riders. From the usage pattern weekdays and weekends but also to the amount of time they use the bike. However one of the biggest hurdle they may encounter correlates with the health climate that has hit the world. More people working from home will take a big chunk of the usual users and having less tourist will also take customers away. They might want to play the long game and hope everything goes back to normal or change their core customer because we might actually never go back to normal.
